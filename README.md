# Text Processing Application

## Project Overview
This repository contains the `textpreprocess.py` script, a text processing application built with Streamlit. The application offers several natural language processing (NLP) tools including humanizing text, summarizing content, and checking grammar. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model through the LangChain library to provide high-quality, conversational language transformations.

## Key Features
- **Humanizer**: Converts AI-generated text into natural, human-like language that is clear and engaging.
- **Text Summarizer**: Condenses lengthy texts into concise summaries, highlighting key points and main ideas.
- **Grammar Checker**: Analyzes and corrects grammatical errors, delivering refined text with perfect grammar.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.
- **LangChain**: For integrating language models and constructing prompt-based chains.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Utilized for processing and generating text.
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
